Is the service RESTful? If not, why not? If so, what key features make it RESTful.
	RESTful is an API that uses HTTPS request to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE. 

What endpoints implement actions that are idempotent? nullipotent?
Endpoints implements are the end of a commmunication channel
Idempotent - multiple performance same after one time.
Nullipotent - no side effect, meaning  perfoming multiple times will be the same as if performing it 0 times.
Therefore in a RESTful service get, put, delete are idempotent because there needs to be a initial call but afterwards there is no difference.
While posting queries is a nullipotent because it returns data without altering the data structure.
